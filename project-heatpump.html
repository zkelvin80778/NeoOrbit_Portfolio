    <h2 id="overview">1. Executive Overview</h2>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Sustained, crewed exploration of Mars requires energy systems that can operate under reduced solar
      irradiance, frequent dust accumulation, and limited opportunities for resupply. Photovoltaic systems scale
      primarily through increased surface area and become constrained by deployment complexity under these
      conditions, while the availability and production rates of suitable radioisotopes limit radioisotope thermoelectric
      generators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting challenge is to develop a scalable surface energy architecture that can operate under
      reduced and variable solar input without relying on extensive photovoltaic arrays or scarce nuclear materials.
    </p>

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
      This project proposes a solar concentrator architecture that mitigates Martian surface energy constraints by
      converting diffuse solar irradiance into thermal energy before electrical utilization. A segmented array of
      parabolic mirrors arranged in a hexagonal geometry focuses sunlight onto a centralized interface that serves
      both as a heat exchanger for a water-based heat pump system and as a mounting surface for thermoelectric
      generator modules.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key Benefit:</strong> By decoupling optical collection from electrical conversion and maintaining alignment
      through active sun tracking, the system prioritizes precision and scalability over large photovoltaic surface area.

      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Energy Density Limits</h3>
        <p>
          On Mars, solar power is reduced by heliocentric distance and degraded by dust. Photovoltaic systems struggle with non-uniform illumination. This motivates approaches that increase usable energy density without massive footprints.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Square-Root Law</h3>
        <p>
          Under concentration, PV current increases linearly while voltage increases logarithmically, leading to diminishing returns. Thermal loading becomes a dominant issue, restricting high-flux PV scaling.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Thermal vs. Electrical</h3>
        <p>
          Thermal pathways tolerate high flux and uneven light better than direct electrical conversion. Absorbing light as heat allows for redistribution and buffering, reducing sensitivity to alignment errors.

    <h3>Overall Energy Flow</h3>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Collection:</strong> 12 hexagonal parabolic mirrors concentrate sunlight toward a shared zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Redirection:</strong> An offset secondary mirror intercepts and redirects the beam to a central target.</li>
      <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> The central plate absorbs flux as heat at a controlled interface.</li>
      <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> Heat is transferred to the heat exchanger or thermoelectric stack.</li>

    <h3>Mirror Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Parabolic mirrors were selected to collimate sunlight into a predictable focal region. A 250 mm hexagonal edge length was chosen to balance manufacturability, stiffness, and handling.
    </p>

    <h3>Iterative Prototyping</h3>
    <p>The design evolved through three major iterations to solve manufacturing defects:</p>
    
    <div class="timeline">
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Iteration 1:</strong> Used hot glue for assembly. Failure: Created protrusions that distorted the mirror surface.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Iteration 2:</strong> Printed flat to save weight. Failure: Warping occurred across unsupported bridge regions.
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-item">
        <strong>Iteration 3:</strong> Modular design with separated reflective surfaces. Result: Better optical quality, though fragile aluminum foil remains a limitation.

    <h2 id="tracking">5. Tracking & Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      The system uses a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) array to track the sun. Four sensors are arranged in a quadrant. When the system is aligned, all four sensors report equal light intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The control objective is not absolute sun position, but the minimization of differential light intensity. This allows the system to self-correct using simple servo motors.
    </p>
