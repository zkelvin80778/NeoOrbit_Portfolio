    <p>
      The growing use of consumer-grade fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers has increased demand for
      thermoplastic filament, while post-consumer plastic waste—particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
      bottles—remains underutilized at small scales. Commercial recycling and filament production systems are
      often centralized or cost-prohibitive, limiting access to local material reuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project investigates a compact mechanical and thermal extrusion system designed to convert post-consumer 
      PET bottles into usable 3D printing filament. The system was developed through multiple prototype iterations 
      addressing challenges in thermal stability, filament diameter consistency, and mechanical alignment. 
      Experimental validation evaluated filament continuity, dimensional consistency, and printability through test 
      extrusions and comparative print trials.
    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">1. Executive Overview</h2>
    
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      The accessibility of consumer-grade 3D printing contrasts with a filament supply chain that remains
      centralized, cost-sensitive, and poorly integrated with local waste streams. Post-consumer PET bottles are 
      abundant, yet small-scale reuse is limited by the difficulty of converting irregular plastic feedstock into 
      dimensionally consistent filament.
    </p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      I often had ideas for hardware projects I wanted to prototype, but spending money without a clear outcome wasn't 
      always an option. At the same time, my mother's restaurant was discarding large numbers of PET bottles while I 
      was buying new filament. This project grew out of the desire to close that loop by turning waste material we 
      already had into something directly useful for prototyping.
    </p>

    <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
    <p>
      This project presents a compact recycling system that mechanically and thermally converts post-consumer PET 
      bottles into usable 3D printing filament. The architecture integrates feedstock preparation, controlled extrusion, 
      and filament drawing in a modular configuration that prioritizes accessibility and process transparency over full 
      automation.
    </p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Key Benefit:</strong> By enabling direct adjustment of temperature and pull speed, the system supports 
      iterative refinement and investigation of material behavior while remaining suitable for small-scale and educational use.

    <h2 id="requirements">2. Design Motivation & Constraints</h2>
    
    <div class="grid-container">
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>PET Processing Window</h3>
        <p>
          PET exhibits a narrow melt-processing range. Variability in post-consumer feedstock constrains allowable 
          temperature margins, requiring stable heating and controlled residence time to prevent degradation or hydrolysis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Fabrication Limits</h3>
        <p>
          The system was designed around manufacturing methods accessible in a small workshop, excluding precision-machined 
          screws. Mechanical simplicity and tolerance to misalignment were prioritized over tight mechanical control.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h3>Operational Safety</h3>
        <p>
          Continuous operation at elevated temperatures necessitated physical separation between heated components and 
          user-adjustable elements to reduce accidental contact while maintaining visual access.

    <h3>Material Flow Path</h3>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Feedstock Prep:</strong> Bottles are cleaned, labels removed, and thermally reformed under pressure to smooth molded grooves. They are then sectioned into continuous strips.</li>
      <li><strong>Thermal Extrusion:</strong> Prepared strips are introduced into a heated assembly where controlled thermal input softens the material through a fixed-diameter nozzle.</li>
      <li><strong>Drawing & Spooling:</strong> Extruded material is drawn into filament using a pulling mechanism. Pull speed is the primary control variable for filament diameter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mechanical">4. Mechanical & Thermal Design</h2>
    
    <h3>Extrusion Assembly</h3>
    <p>
      The extrusion assembly uses a modified Ender 3 hot end to leverage a well-characterized thermal system. 
      The stock brass nozzle was drilled to 1.7 mm to reduce flow restriction. Temperature sensing was decoupled 
      from the stock thermistor and replaced with a K-type thermocouple bonded with thermal epoxy for higher robustness.
    </p>

    <h3>Material Selection</h3>
    <p>
      The mounting bracket was fabricated from PETG to improve thermal tolerance relative to PLA. 
      The heat block was mechanically offset from the PETG structure using M2.5 spacers to limit heat transfer 
      to load-bearing components.

    <h2 id="iterations">5. Iterative Development</h2>
    
    <h3>Iteration 1 (Current)</h3>
    <p>
      Focused on proof of concept. Filament diameter exhibited strong sensitivity to pull speed, and the absence of 
      active cooling limited stability. Variations in bottle thickness caused inconsistent melt flow.
    </p>

    <h3>Iteration 2 (In Development)</h3>
    <p>
      Replaces the commercial hot end with a custom CNC-machined assembly and modular nozzles. 
      Adds active cooling for both the hot end and extruded filament. Transitions control to a custom ESP32-based PCB.

    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Recycled filament was evaluated against commercial PETG using identical print settings (with reduced temperature for rPET). 
      Validation prints included vase-mode structures and stringing tests.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Observations</h3>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Continuous Extrusion:</strong> The vase-mode print completed successfully with surface quality comparable to PETG.</li>
      <li><strong>Stringing:</strong> The recycled filament showed higher sensitivity to stringing, emphasizing the need for consistent cooling.</li>
      <li><strong>Functional Use:</strong> Despite dimensional variability, the filament demonstrated sufficient continuity for functional parts.</li>
    </ul>
